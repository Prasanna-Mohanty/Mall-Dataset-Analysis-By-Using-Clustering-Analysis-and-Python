<p>Customer Segmentation Analysis: -</p>
<p>Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group more effectively. The goal of segmenting customers is to decide how to relate to customers in each segment in order to maximize the value of each customer to the business. Segmentation helps a company to Create and communicate targeted marketing strategy that will resonate with specific groups of customers, which improve customer service and establish better customer relationships.</p>
<p>To Perform this segmentation analysis, I’ve used a dataset as input from a Super Market. Whenever a customer applied for a membership, they need to fill the membership form. From which the mall gets the details like Name, Age, Gender, Annual Income etc. Based on this information, the super market categorises the customers and sends promotional offer to increase the sale.</p>
<p>Below is the Mall Dataset: -</p>
<p>Customer ID</p>
<p>Gender</p>
<p>Age</p>
<p>Annual Income</p>
<p>Spending Score</p>
<p>I’ve performed this analysis by using KMeans and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis.</p>
<p>I segregated the entire analysis into 3 different parts.</p>
<p>Part 1 – Data Preprocessing</p>
<p>Part 2 – Data Visualization</p>
<p>Part 3 – Applying KMeans/HC Alogorithm.</p>
